# React + TypeScript + Vite Game Project 🎮

Welcome to the React + TypeScript + Vite game project! 

🚀 This repository is the perfect starting point for building dynamic, high-performance web applications with React, TypeScript, and Vite. We've also included ESLint configuration to ensure your code remains clean, consistent, and production-ready. 💻✨

# Features 🌟
Blazing Fast Development: Powered by Vite, experience lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for an unparalleled development experience.
React with TypeScript: Write robust and type-safe code with TypeScript, while leveraging React's flexibility and power.
Configurable ESLint Rules: Ensure high-quality code with extensible ESLint configurations, including options for type-aware linting.
Choose Your Compiler:

**@vitejs/plugin-react: Utilizes Babel for fast refresh.**

**@vitejs/plugin-react-swc: Leverages SWC for enhanced performance.**

# Optimized ESLint Setup 🛠️
For production-grade applications, we recommend enabling type-aware lint rules. Here's how you can extend the default configuration:

Configure parserOptions:

```javascript
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```
Upgrade Recommended Config:

Replace **tseslint.configs.recommended** with **tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked** or **tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked**.

Optionally include **...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked** for stylistic consistency.
Enhance React Plugin Support: Install eslint-plugin-react and update your ESLint configuration:

```javascript
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  settings: { react: { version: 'detect' } },
  plugins: { react },
  rules: {
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```
# Why Choose This Template? 🤔
🚀 Speed and Performance: With Vite at the core, say goodbye to sluggish builds.

🧑‍💻 Developer Experience: Hot reload, JSX syntax, and strict typing make your workflow seamless.

✅ Quality Assurance: Enforced ESLint rules ensure a bug-free, maintainable codebase.

🔧 Flexible Configuration: Easily swap between Babel or SWC based on your project needs.
